# Hellion's Biomeless Sniffer+

Welcome to Hellion's Biomeless Sniffer+! This is a 1.20 Expansion mod building on features surrounding the Sniffer. This includes new behaviors for the Sniffer itself; several new plants for it to dig up, including a new woodset, housing all these wonders! Though from the original mod, this removes the cave biome which could be used to find sniffer's in.

## Features:
- Sniffers now can be saddled and ridden
- Sniffers can now have chests equipped
- Sniffers with equipped chests will place dug up seeds in their chest
- Sniffers can be given an Ominous Banner to carry you to the nearest Outpost
- Several new plants including Ivy, Stone Pine Trees, and Fiddleferns
- Torchflowers now emit light, earning themselves their name
